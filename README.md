// About: A little programming project to continue to familiarize myself with C#, .Net, GitHub, and Visual Studio.
//        Learned a lot making this little thing, and it is by no means perfect, but I believe I accomplished
//        what I set out to do with this project, which was mainly to gain experience building on my previous blackjack program.
//        As a functional representation of five-card draw, there's much more that can be implemented, but there
//        are many better avenues to play it and I'm eager to move onto my next project.
